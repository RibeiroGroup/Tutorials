# Year 2025
This directory contains the 2025 sequence of tutorials for the [Ribeiro Group](https://ribeiro.emorychem.science/). The modules below extend core computational and quantum foundations toward modern quantum optics, quantum transport, and topological condensed-matter physics.

The goal of this yearâ€™s curriculum is to provide students with a unified perspective on quantum dynamics across cavity QED platforms, open transport channels, and topological systems.

## ðŸ“¦ Contents
1. [Jaynesâ€“Tavisâ€“Cummings Model:](Tutorials_2025/JaynesTavisCummingsModel/TC_JC_tutorial_final_question_only.ipynb) Fundamentals of cavity QED with one quantized mode. Covers Rabi splitting, strong coupling and suggested follow-up exercises.
2. [Quantum Dynamics & Transport:](Tutorials_2025/Transport/Dynamics&Transport.ipynb) Construction of the Hamiltonian matrix, time-dependent evolution, and coherence in tight-binding quantum systems. Introduces transport observables and dynamical simulations.
3. [Integer Quantum Hall Effect (IQHE):](Tutorials_2025/Quantum_Hall_Effect/QHE.ipynb) Starting from the (classical) Hall effect you will review concepts such as magnetic Bloch bands, Chern numbers, and edge states. Framework for understanding topology in quantum materials.
