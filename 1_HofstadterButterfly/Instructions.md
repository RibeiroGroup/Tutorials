# Hofstadter Butterfly

In this excersice, you will uncover the Butterfly spectrum originally found by Hofstadter in the article Phys. Rev. B 14, 2239 (1976), which has been elected a Milestone article by the American Physical Society.
In this problem, you are asked to work out some properties of the spectrum of an electron in an external magnetic field on a 2D lattice. This system supports electronic bands with Chern numbers that are the building blocks to understand the Quantum Hall effect.

## 2D Lattice coupled to an external perpendicular magnetic field

Consider a 2D square lattice with lattice parameter $a$, with the following Hamiltonian
$$\hat{H} =  \sum_{\boldsymbol{r},\boldsymbol{r}'}t_{r,r'}e^{-i \frac{e}{\hbar}\alpha(\boldsymbol{r},\boldsymbol{r}')}\psi^\dagger(\boldsymbol{r})\psi(\boldsymbol{r}') + \text{h.c.},$$
where $\boldsymbol{r}=a(m,n)$ (being $m,n$ integers) is the position vector in the 2D crystal, and $t_{\boldsymbol{r},\boldsymbol{r}'}=-t$ is the real hopping parameter between closest neighbors.
